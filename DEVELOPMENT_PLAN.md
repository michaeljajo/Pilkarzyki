## Key Technical Decisions

### Database Schema
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** with Row Level Security
- **Clerk user IDs** as foreign keys for auth integration
- **Comprehensive types** already defined in `src/types/index.ts`

### Architecture Patterns
- **App Router** with server/client components
- **Three Supabase clients**: basic, client-side with auth, server-side with auth
- **Clerk middleware** for route protection
- **TypeScript strict mode** throughout

## Notes & Reminders

- **Pro Limit Management**: Take breaks between phases to reset message limits
- **Sequential Development**: Each phase builds on the previous
- **Database First**: Phase 1 is critical - everything else depends on it
- **Testing Strategy**: Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- **Backup Plan**: Save progress frequently, document any blockers
